# cats

A library _and community_ for functional programming in Scala.

---

# community

The cats community strives to lower barriers to functional programming in Scala through:

- an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment
  - adhering to the [typelevel code of conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html)
- learning resources
  - [docs and tutorials](http://typelevel.org/cats/)
  - an active [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats) (over 1000 people and counting!)
- an open [source](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) library

---

# influences

heavily influenced by:
- haskell libraries (semigroupoids)
- scalaz
- math (algebra and category theory)

... but you don't need to know those.

---

#  imports

These imports are assumed throughout the presentation.

```tut:silent
import cats._
import cats.data.NonEmptyList
import cats.implicits._

// in tests
import org.scalatest.FunSuite
import org.typelevel.discipline.scalatest.Discipline
import cats.kernel.laws.GroupLaws
import org.scalacheck.{Arbitrary, Gen}
```

---

# the task

We have a bunch of page-view data.

Calculate the average page-view duration for various user segments.

Data is spread across nodes, so we'll need to combine various intermediate calculations.

Given the average for node `A` and node `B` we'll need to calculate the combined average.

---

# Averages

Let's start simple:

```tut:silent
case class Avg(value: Double)
```

--

We can write a `combine` function such that:

```scala
Avg(2.0) combine Avg(4.0)
```

will produce `Avg(3.0)`.

---

# semigroups

Semigroups combine elements of the same type into another element of that type.

```tut:silent
// in `Example` namespace so we don't clobber the one provided by cats
object Example {
  trait Semigroup[A] {
    def combine(a1: A, a2: A): A
  }
}
```

This `combine` operation must be _associative_. We'll get to that later.

???

Note that I'm focusing on how these are commonly represented in the Scala world and that I'm glossing over details of the mathematical definition.

Computer science is really young. Math has been around much longer. It's nice to piggy-back off of millenia of study and experience.

---

# type classes

Instead of making the `Avg` class extend `Semigroup` (the OO approach), we create an _instance_ of the type class for `Avg`.

```tut:silent
implicit val semigroupAvg: Semigroup[Avg] = new Semigroup[Avg] {
  def combine(a1: Avg, a2: Avg): Avg = Avg((a1.value + a2.value) / 2.0)
}
```

```tut:book
semigroupAvg.combine(Avg(2.0), Avg(4.0))
```

---

# type class syntax

Instead of:

```tut:silent
semigroupAvg.combine(Avg(2.0), Avg(4.0))
```

It would be nice if we could do something like:

```scala
Avg(2.0) combine Avg(4.0)
```

--

Since we made our type class instance `implicit`, we can add this syntax helper:

```tut:silent
object Example {
  implicit class SemigroupOps[A](a: A)(implicit sa: Semigroup[A]) {
    def combine(a2: A): A = sa.combine(a, a2)
  }
}
```

---

# type class syntax (cont.)

Cats includes this syntax for us:

```tut:book
Avg(2.0) combine Avg(4.0)
```

There's also an alias for the symbolically-inclined:

```tut:book
Avg(2.0) |+| Avg(4.0)
```

---

# semigroup laws

Semigroups must be associative:

```scala
(a1 combine a2) combine a3
```

is equivalent to:

```scala
a1 combine (a2 combine a3)
```

---

# laws

It's common (and encouraged!) for type classes to have laws defining their behavior.

Laws can help us:
- reason about behavior
- safely substitute optimizations
  - The _functor identity_ law says that `x.map(identity)` is equivalent to `x`, so if we see `List(1, 2, 3).map(identity)` we can replace it with `List(1, 2, 3)`.
- test our implementation

---

# Eq

`Eq` is a type class for equality.

```tut:silent
object Example {
  trait Eq[A] {
    def eqv(a1: A, a2: A): Boolean
  }
}
```

---

# Eq laws

- reflexivity
  - .grouping[`a eqv a`] is true
- symmetry
  - .grouping[`a1 eqv a2`] implies .grouping[`a2 eqv a1`]
- transitivity
  - .grouping[`(a1 eqv a2) && (a2 eqv a3)`] implies .grouping[`a1 eqv a3`]
- antisymmetry
  - .grouping[`a1 eqv a2`] implies .grouping[`f(a1) eqv f(a2)`]

---

# property-based tests

Generate data and ensure that it passes certain properties.

Example from the [Scalacheck home page](https://www.scalacheck.org/):

```scala
property("startsWith") = forAll { (a: String, b: String) =>
  (a+b).startsWith(a)
}
```

String data is generated by the implicit `Arbitrary[String]` instance. `Arbitrary` is a type class for generating data.
---

# property-based tests with laws

Cats includes modules that help you test that your type class intances satisfy the laws.

In order to test our `Semigroup[Avg]` instances, we'll need an `Eq[Avg]` instance so the tests know wheter results are equivalent:

```tut:silent
implicit val eqAvg: Eq[Avg] = Eq.by(_.value)
```

--

We'll also need to generate arbitrary `Avg` values:

```tut:silent
implicit val arbAvg: Arbitrary[Avg] = Arbitrary(
  Gen.chooseNum(-1.0e9, 1.0e9).map(Avg(_)))
```

---

# testing our semigroup

```tut:silent
class AvgTests extends FunSuite with Discipline {
  checkAll("Avg", GroupLaws[Avg].semigroup)
}
```

```tut:book
org.scalatest.run(new AvgTests)
```
---

# associativity violation

```tut:silent
val x = Avg(0.0)
val y = Avg(12.0)
val z = Avg(12.0)
```

```tut:book
(x combine y) combine z

x combine (y combine z)
```
---

# example failure test output

```
- Avg.semigroup.associativity *** FAILED ***
  GeneratorDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException was thrown during property evaluation.
   (Discipline.scala:14)
    Falsified after 0 successful property evaluations.
    Location: (Discipline.scala:14)
    Occurred when passed generated values (
      arg0 = Avg(-4.387066426000916E8),
      arg1 = Avg(7.692464704471469E8),
      arg2 = Avg(-8.073288449590896E8)
    )
    Label of failing property:
      (Avg(-3.21029465517781E8) ?== Avg(-2.2887391492803147E8)) failed
```

???

This is an example of a test failure. Since there is some nondeterminism in the tests, you aren't guaranteed to get one.
---

# weighted average

Okay we didn't think that through. We should be using the _weighted_ average.

```tut:silent
case class Avg(weight: Long, avg: Double)

implicit val semigroupAvg: Semigroup[Avg] = new Semigroup[Avg] {
  def combine(a1: Avg, a2: Avg): Avg = Avg(
    weight = a1.weight + a2.weight,
    avg = (a1.weight * a1.avg + a2.weight * a2.avg) /
      (a1.weight + a2.weight))
}
```

---

# testing the weighted average

First let's give it a quick spot check:

```tut:silent
def single(value: Double): Avg = Avg(1L, value)

val x = single(0.0)
val y = single(12.0)
val z = single(12.0)
```

```tut:book
x combine (y combine z)

(x combine y) combine z
```

Looking good so far.

---

# testing the weighted average (cont.)

Now for equality we need to check both the `weight` and the `avg`. We'll use the `fromUniversalEquals` helper, since by default the case class will have the `equals` semantics that we want.

```tut:silent
implicit val eqAvg: Eq[Avg] = Eq.fromUniversalEquals
```

--

We now need two different fields in our arbitrary data:

```tut:silent
implicit val arbAvg: Arbitrary[Avg] = Arbitrary(
  for {
    weight <- Gen.chooseNum(1L, 1e9.toLong)
    avg <- Gen.chooseNum(-1.0e9, 1.0e9)
  } yield Avg(weight, avg))
```

Our test itself doesn't change:

```tut:silent
class AvgTests extends FunSuite with Discipline {
  checkAll("Avg", GroupLaws[Avg].semigroup)
}
```

---

# testing the weighted average (cont.)

```tut:book
org.scalatest.run(new AvgTests)
```

---

# another associativity failure

```
Avg.semigroup.associativity *** FAILED ***
GeneratorDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException was thrown during property evaluation.
 (Discipline.scala:14)
  Falsified after 0 successful property evaluations.
  Location: (Discipline.scala:14)
  Occurred when passed generated values (
    arg0 = Avg(1,-5.164915425926655E8),
    arg1 = Avg(1000000000,-1.0E9),
    arg2 = Avg(716556116,-1.0)
  )
  Label of failing property:
    (Avg(1716556117,-5.825617882978001E8) ?== Avg(1716556117,-5.825617882978E8)) failed
```

???

This is an example of a failing test case. Since there is some nondetermism in the tests you aren't guaranteed to get one.

# floating point arithmetic isn't associative!

```tut:silent
val x = 0.1
val y = 0.2
val z = 0.3
```

```tut:book
x + (y + z)

(x + y) + z
```
---

# what now?

With minimal effort put into tests, the laws caught an associativity issue with floating point arithmetic that we likely wouldn't have caught on our own.

We have a few options:
- decide it's close enough and disable the tests
- change the `Eq[Avg]` instance in the tests to have a fudge-factor in the `Double` comparison
  - defining the behavior in a type class instance instead of the structure itself is handy!
  - but this is still playing with fire
- use another numeric type that doesn't suffer from precision issues
 - such as integers or [spire](https://github.com/non/spire)'s `Rational`

---

# good old integer arithmetic

In this case, we know that `sum` is a duration of a page view, so we can use a `Long` to represent milliseconds.

If we keep track of a cumulative weight and sum then we can avoid floating point arithmetic until we are ready for the final result.

```tut:silent
case class Avg(weight: Long, sum: Long) {
  def avg: Double = sum.toDouble / weight.toDouble
}

implicit val semigroupAvg: Semigroup[Avg] = new Semigroup[Avg] {
  def combine(a1: Avg, a2: Avg): Avg = Avg(
    weight = a1.weight + a2.weight,
    sum = a1.sum + a2.sum)
}
```

---
# testing the new approach

Let's give it another spot check:

```tut:silent
def single(value: Long): Avg = Avg(1L, value)

val x = single(0)
val y = single(12)
val z = single(12)
```

```tut:book
val r1 = x combine (y combine z)

val r2 = (x combine y) combine z

r1.avg

r2.avg
```

Looking good so far again...

---

# setting up the tests again

```tut:silent
// even if we compare values by the `avg` Double we don't hit floating
// point associativity issues, because we do integer arithmetic up
// until the final `avg` call that is used for comparison.
implicit val eqAvg: Eq[Avg] = Eq.by(_.avg)

implicit val arbAvg: Arbitrary[Avg] = Arbitrary(
  for {
    weight <- Gen.chooseNum(1L, 1e9.toLong)
    sum <- Gen.chooseNum(-1e9.toLong, 1e9.toLong)
  } yield Avg(weight, sum))

class AvgTests extends FunSuite with Discipline {
  checkAll("Avg", GroupLaws[Avg].semigroup)
}
```

---

# running the tests again

```tut:book
org.scalatest.run(new AvgTests)
```

No more associativity errors!

---

# semigroup tricks

Now that we have a valid semigroup instance we can do some handy things with it.

```tut:silent
val (x, y, z) = (single(1L), single(2L), single(3L))
```

```tut:book
Semigroup.combineAllOption(List(x, y, z))

NonEmptyList.of(x, y, z).reduce

Option(x) combine Option(y)

Option(x) combine None

Map("/home" -> x, "/about" -> y) |+| Map("/home" -> z, "/contact" -> x)
```
